# Smart Commute Deployment

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to demonstrate what are the services involved. Starting from this `yml` file, it is possible to generate the Openshift resources using [kompose](https://kompose.io/).

Before using `docker-compose`, it is needed to run the [pipeline to build the services](pipelines/build-docker-images.sh).
